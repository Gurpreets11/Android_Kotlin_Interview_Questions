## Android Questions

* **What is Android?**

	**Answer:**
	Android is an open source operating system and is mainly popular for Smartphones and Tablets. This operating system is Linux Kernel based. Using Android operating system, the developer develops the functions or programs which can perform basic as well as the advanced type of operations on the Smartphone.

* **What is Android SDK?**

	**Answer:**
	To develop a mobile application, Android developers require some tools and this requirement is satisfied by ‚ÄúAndroid SDK‚Äù which is a set of tools that are used for developing or writing apps.It has a Graphical User Interface which emulates the Android environment. This emulator acts as an actual mobile device on which the developers write their code and then debug/test the same code to check if anything is wrong.

* **What is Application?**

	**Answer:**
	The Application class in Android is the base class within an Android app that contains all other components such as activities and services. The Application class, or any subclass of the Application class, is instantiated before any other class when the process for your application/package is created.

* **Explain Android Architecture briefly.**

	**Answer:**
	Android architecture is in the form of software stack components.
	The below diagram describes the different layers in the Android architecture.
	- **Linux Kernel:** Linux Kernel is placed at the bottom of the software stack and is the foundation of the Android architecture. Using Linux kernel, Android provides a connection between the other layers of the software. It helps to develop drivers like the keypad, display, audio for device manufacture etc.
	- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** HAL provides an interface between device drivers and API framework. It consists of library modules which are specific to the hardware component.
	- **Android Runtime:** Linux kernel provides multi-tasking execution environment so that multiple processes can execute each process runs on its own instance of Android Runtime (ART). Android has core runtime libraries like Dalvik VM specific libraries, Java Interoperability Libraries, Android Libraries and C/C++ libraries.
	- **Application Framework (Java API Framework):** The entire android functionalities are available through the API. It consists of multiple services like Activity Manager, Resource Manager, Notification Manager, etc., which form the environment in which the android application runs.
	- **Applications:** The Android application is a top layer and all types of in-built applications such as SMS, Browsers, Contact, etc are included in this top layer. It also includes third party applications which are installed by the user such as Games, etc.

</p>



* **Explain the build process in Android?**
	
	**Answer:**
	The build process in Android involves three steps
	- The first step consists of the compilation of the resources folder using the Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT). These are compiled into a single class file known as R.java, which only holds constants.
	- In the second step, the java source code needs to be compiled to .class files using javac, which are then converted to Dalvik bytecode using the ‚Äòdx‚Äô tool, which is one of the tools in the software development kit. The final output file is classes.ex.
	- In the third and final step, the Android apkbuilder is required to take all the inputs and build the Android Packaging Key (APK) file.


* **What are the different tools available in Android development? Explain their functions.**
	
	**Answer:**
	There are a variety of tools available to help Android developers:
	- **Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and Virtual Device Manager:** This tool is used to generate and handle Android Virtual Devices (AVD) and SDKs. Through the emulator in the AVD, you can specify the supported SDK version, storage in the SD card, screen resolution, and other abilities such as GPS and touch screen.
	- **The Android Emulator:** The AE is the implementation of the Android Virtual Machine, designed to run processes within a virtual device itself, which can be used on a development computer. The main use of this tool is in testing and debugging of Android applications. 
	- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB):** The ADB is a command line debugging application doled out with the SDK. It enables developers to communicate with the device, and facilitates actions such as the installation and debugging of an application.
	- **Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT):** The AAPT builds the ‚Äò.apk‚Äô distributable Android package file.


* **What is Context?**

	**Answer:**
	The Context in Android, as its name suggests, is the context of the current  state of your application or object. The context comes with services such as giving access to databases and preferences, resolving resources and much more. There are two types of context:
	- **Activity Context:** This context is attached to the lifecycle of an activity. It should be used when you are passing the context in the scope of an activity or you need the context whose lifecycle is attached to the current context.
	- **Application Context:** This context is attached to the lifecycle of an application. The application context can be used where you need a context whose lifecycle is separate from the current context or when you are passing a context beyond the scope of an activity.



* **What is an Activity in Android, and why is it important?**

    **Answer:**
	An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface in Android. It acts as an entry point for interacting with the app's UI. Activities are essential because they manage the lifecycle of the app's UI components and handle user interaction.

* **Explain the Android activity lifecycle.**

    **Answer:**
	The Android activity lifecycle defines a series of states an activity goes through, from creation to destruction. Key lifecycle methods include:
	- **onCreate():** Called when the activity is first created.
	- **onStart():** Called when the activity becomes visible to the user.
	- **onResume():** Called when the activity starts interacting with the user.
	- **onPause():** Called when the activity is partially visible and interacting with the user is paused.
	- **onStop():** Called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
	- **onDestroy():** Called when the activity is being destroyed.

* **What is a Fragment, and how does it differ from an Activity?**

    **Answer:**
        A Fragment is a reusable portion of UI that can be embedded within an Activity. Unlike an Activity, a fragment cannot exist independently; it must be hosted within an activity. Fragments help in building flexible and reusable UIs, especially in larger screens like tablets.

* **What is the difference between onCreate() and onStart() in an Android Activity?**

    **Answer:**
	- **onCreate()** is called when the activity is first created, and it is used for initial setup, such as inflating the UI and initializing components.
	- **onStart()** is called just before the activity becomes visible to the user, typically after onCreate(). It is used to start processes that should be visible to the user but not necessarily interactive yet.

* **What are the types of Intent in Android?**

    **Answer:**
	There are two types of Intent:
	- **Explicit Intent:** Used to launch a specific activity or service by specifying the exact component name.
	- **Implicit Intent:** Used when the component is not specified, and Android resolves the intent to an appropriate app or component that can handle the action (e.g., sharing content or opening a web link).



## Basic Kotlin Questions

* **What is the difference between var and val in Kotlin?**

    **Answer:**
        var is used to declare a mutable variable, meaning its value can be changed.
        val is used to declare an immutable variable, meaning its value cannot be changed after it's assigned.

* **Explain nullable types in Kotlin. What is the ? operator?**

    **Answer:**
        In Kotlin, a type can be nullable by adding ? to its type. For example, String? means the variable can hold either a String value or null.
        The ? operator is used to make a type nullable, allowing safe handling of null values.

* **What are Kotlin's primary constructors and secondary constructors?**

    **Answer:**
        A primary constructor is defined in the class header and is used to initialize class properties.
        Secondary constructors are defined within the class body using the constructor keyword and are used when more complex initialization is needed.

* **What are data classes in Kotlin?**

    **Answer:**
        Data classes are classes that are used to hold data. They automatically provide useful methods like toString(), hashCode(), equals(), and copy() by default. A data class must have at least one primary constructor parameter.

* **What is a sealed class in Kotlin, and why is it useful?**

    **Answer:**
        A sealed class is a class that restricts the inheritance hierarchy. All subclasses of a sealed class must be defined in the same file. This makes it useful when representing restricted or fixed sets of types, such as in state handling or modeling success/failure outcomes.

* **What is the purpose of companion object in Kotlin?**

    **Answer:**
        companion object is used to define static members or functions in a class, similar to static members in Java. It allows you to create a single object associated with a class, giving access to properties and methods that are common to all instances of the class.

## Core Java Questions

* **What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?**

	**Answer:**
    
	**JDK (Java Development Kit):**
        It is a development environment for building applications, applets, and components using Java. It includes the JRE, compiler (javac), and other tools (like javadoc and java debugger).
        It is required for developing Java applications.

    **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**
        It provides the libraries, JVM, and other components to run applications written in Java.
        It does not contain any development tools like compilers and debuggers.
        If you only want to run a Java program, JRE is sufficient.

    **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
        It is a part of JRE responsible for executing Java bytecode.
        JVM provides a platform-independent way of executing Java code, which is why Java is known as "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
        It performs several tasks like memory management (using Garbage Collection) and security checks.

* **Explain the concept of OOPs and its principles (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction).**

    **Answer:**
	
	**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
        It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (fields or attributes) and methods (functions).
        It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation into programming.

    **Principles of OOP:**
	
    **Inheritance:** It allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The existing class is called the parent class or superclass, and the derived class is called the child class or subclass.
        
	**Encapsulation:** It is the mechanism of wrapping the data (fields) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It also restricts access to the internal state of an object using access modifiers.
        
	**Polymorphism:** It means "many forms." In Java, it allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The two types are compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).
    
	**Abstraction:** It hides the implementation details from the user and only shows the functionality. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in Java.

* **What are the various access specifiers in Java? Explain their scope.**

	**Answer:**
	
	Java provides four access specifiers that determine the scope of a class, variable, method, or constructor:
	
	**public:**
    Visible everywhere in the project.
    It can be accessed from any class, regardless of the package.
    
	**protected:**
    Visible within the same package and subclasses in different packages.
    Often used when inheritance is involved.
    
	**default (no modifier):**
    Visible only within the same package.
    If no access specifier is specified, it is considered default.
    
	**private:**
    Visible only within the same class.
    It cannot be accessed from any other class.

* **What is the difference between == and equals() in Java?**

	**Answer:**
    
	**== Operator:**
	
    It is a reference comparison operator.
    It checks whether two references point to the same memory location.
    For primitive types, it compares the actual values.
    
	Example:
		
		String str1 = "Hello";
		String str2 = "Hello";
		System.out.println(str1 == str2); // true (because they refer to the same memory location)

	**equals() Method:**

	It is used for content comparison between objects.
	In the String class, it is overridden to compare the actual contents.
	
	Example:
		
		String str1 = new String("Hello");
		String str2 = new String("Hello");
		System.out.println(str1.equals(str2)); // true (because it compares the content)
		System.out.println(str1 == str2); // false (because they are different objects)


* **What is a constructor in Java? Explain the types of constructors.**

	**Answer:**
    
    A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated.
    It initializes the object and sets up its initial state.
    Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
    They must have the same name as the class.
    
	**Types of Constructors:**
    
	**Default Constructor:** A no-argument constructor provided by the compiler if no constructor is defined.
    It initializes the object with default values.
    Example:
			
		class MyClass {
			MyClass() {
				System.out.println("Default constructor called");
			}
		}

	**Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor that takes one or more parameters to initialize the object with specific values.
    Example:

		class MyClass {
			int x;
			MyClass(int value) {
				this.x = value;
			}
		}



* **What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?**

	**Answer:**

	**Method Overloading:**
	It occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (type, number, or order).
	It is a compile-time polymorphism.
	
	Example:
	
		class MyClass {
			void display(int a) {}
			void display(String b) {}
		}


	**Method Overriding:**
	It occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass.
	It is a runtime polymorphism.
	
	Example:
	
		class Parent {
			void show() {}
		}

		class Child extends Parent {
			@Override
			void show() {}
		}


* **What is an interface, and how is it different from an abstract class?**
	**Answer:**

	**Interface:**

	It is a reference type in Java, similar to a class, that can contain only abstract methods (until Java 7) and default or static methods (from Java 8).
	All fields in an interface are public, static, and final by default.
	A class implements an interface and provides implementations for its methods.
    
	**Differences from Abstract Class:**

	- Abstract Class: Can have both abstract and concrete methods, instance variables, and constructors.
	- Interface: Cannot have instance variables or constructors. Only contains abstract methods (before Java 8).
	- Multiple Inheritance: A class can implement multiple interfaces but can extend only one abstract class.

* **What is the use of the final keyword in Java?**
  **Answer:**

  The final keyword is used in different contexts:

  **final variable:**

  - Its value cannot be changed once assigned.
  - It becomes a constant.
  - Example: 
	    
		final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
    
  **final method:**
  - Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
  - Example:
		
		class Parent {
		final void show() {}
		}

  **final class:**

  - Cannot be subclassed.
  - Example:
	
		final class MyClass {}


  **final parameter:**
  - The parameter value cannot be changed inside the method.
  - Example: 

		void method(final int x) {}
		

* **Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java.**

  **Answer:**

  **ArrayList:**

  - Uses a dynamic array to store elements.
  - Provides faster access time (O(1)) for accessing elements by index.
  - Insertion and deletion are slower (O(n)) because elements need to be shifted.
  - Better for random access and smaller data sets.

  **LinkedList:**

  - Uses a doubly linked list to store elements.
  - Access time is slower (O(n)) as it requires traversal.
  - Insertion and deletion are faster (O(1)) as it involves adjusting pointers.
  - Better for frequent insertions and deletions.
		



* **What is a HashMap? How does it work internally?**

	**Answer:**

	**HashMap:**
	- It is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements the Map interface.
	- It stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
	- Allows one null key and multiple null values.
	- Provides O(1) time complexity for get() and put() operations in the average case.

	**How HashMap Works Internally:**
	- It uses a hashing mechanism where a hash code is generated for each key.
	- The hash code determines the bucket where the key-value pair is stored.
	- If two keys have the same hash code, a collision occurs, and HashMap uses a linked list or binary tree (if the list length exceeds 8) to store multiple values in the same bucket.
	- The HashMap uses load factor (default is 0.75) to decide when to resize the internal array to maintain performance.

* **What are static methods and variables? Can we override a static method?**

	**Answer:**

	**static Variables:**
	
	- A static variable belongs to the class rather than an instance.
    - It is shared among all instances of the class.
    - Only one copy exists regardless of the number of objects created.
    - Example:
		
		  class Counter {
			static int count = 0;
			Counter() { count++; }
		  }


	**static Methods:**
	
	- A static method belongs to the class rather than any object of the class.
	- It can be called without creating an instance of the class.
	- Cannot access instance variables directly; only static variables or other static methods can be accessed.
	- Example:
	
		  class Utility {
			static void printMessage() {
				System.out.println("Hello, World!");
			}
		  }



	**Can We Override a static Method?**

	- No, static methods cannot be overridden because method overriding depends on dynamic (runtime) binding, whereas static methods are resolved at compile-time (static binding).
	- However, method hiding can occur if a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as in the parent class. The version of the method called depends on the class type used to make the call, not on the object type.
	
	


	














* **Explain in detail Java 8 Features?**

	**Answer:**
	
	Java 8 introduced several major features that significantly enhanced the language, focusing on functional programming, improved concurrency, and ease of development. Learn java 8 features in details [from here](https://buffmycode.com/index.php/2023/05/31/java-8-features/)
